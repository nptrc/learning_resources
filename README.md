# 📚 My Learning Resources

## 👨‍💻 About me

I am an embedded systems student, and I am learning about embedded systems, programming, and electronics. I created this repository to store all the resources I find useful in my learning journey. I hope this repository will be useful to others as well.

I mainly follow the roadmap in this repository: [Embedded Systems Engineering Roadmap](https://github.com/m3y54m/Embedded-Engineering-Roadmap). If you don't have time, you can quickly check the roadmap below.

## 📚 Resources

Although I am an embedded systems student, I am also interested in other topics such as computer science, data science, machine learning, artificial intelligence, and so on. I will also share resources on these topics. You can see the folder structure below to navigate through the resources.

```txt
📁 learning_resources
├── 📁 Programming
│   ├── 📁 Languages
│   │   ├── 📁 C
```

> [!WARNING]
> You don't need to read all the resources. Just choose the resources that you think will be useful to you.

> [!TIP]
> To differentiate between the types of learning resources and the quality of their content, specific symbols are used before each item.

> **Resource types:**
>
> - 📘 : Books
> - 🎞️ : Videos
> - 📝 : Write-ups, articles, and blog posts
> - 🔗 : Other links that do not fit into any of the above categories
